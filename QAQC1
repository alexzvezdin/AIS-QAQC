#QAQC script V2 June 20 2024

#1. Set up work environment and install/load required packages

#1.1 It's always good to check where your working directory is, and then
# set it to the one you need. *If you need to work on data exports from another 
# date, change the date folder (here it's 2024-05-06) and leave everything else 
# as is 

getwd()
setwd("G:/Aquatic Invasive Species/Data Management/Data Exports/2024-05-06/QAQC")

#this location is important! all output files will also be stored here after QAQC. 
#If R gives you the following error: Error in setwd("G:/Aquatic Invasive Species/Data Management/Data Exports/2024-05-06/Raw") : 
#cannot change working directory, to solve do the following
#1. check that you are logged in Entrust and connected to the VPN
#2. Open your file explorer and click on the G: drive making sure the red "x" 
##disappears and you're connected. Sometimes you're not connected to the drive 
##despite being connected to the VPN and clicking on it solves this.

#1.2 Install/load packages

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("ggtext")
install.packages("purrr")

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggtext)
library(purrr)

#2. Import data 
# 
# If there is field unit specific data to import, "uncomment the section" specific 
# to field units. To "uncomment" press ctrl+shift+c

#2.1 Import data. Rememberto change the YYYY-DD-MM folder name to match your attribute table export date.

cc <- read.csv("G:/Aquatic Invasive Species/Data Management/Data Exports/2024-05-06/Raw/cc.csv")
em <- read.csv("G:/Aquatic Invasive Species/Data Management/Data Exports/2024-05-06/Raw/em.csv")
emrel <- read.csv("G:/Aquatic Invasive Species/Data Management/Data Exports/2024-05-06/Raw/emrel.csv")

#2.5 Rename variables that were inconsistent from one survey to another in Survey123

#2.5.1 Check the column names in all the data.frames

colnames(cc) #has Surveyors column
colnames(em) #has Surveyors column
colnames(emrel) #no Surveyors column
colnames(sc) #Surveyors is called Data.Entered.By
colnames(screl) #no Surveyors column
colnames(wis) #Surveyors is called Inspection.Completed.By *TO BE FIXED IN S123*
colnames(wisrel) #no Surveyors column

#2.5.2 Rename columns as needed here

sc <- sc %>%
  rename(Surveyors = Data.Entered.By)

wis <- wis %>%
  rename(Surveyors = Inspection.Completed.By)

#3. Merge data frames

#Make a list of data frames
dataFrames <- list(
  list(main=wis, rel=wisrel),
  list(main=sc, rel=screl),
  list(main=em, rel=emrel)
)

for (pair in dataFrames) {
  mainDf <- pair$main
  relDf <- pair$rel
  
  #Merge based on GlobalID and ParentGlobalID
  mergedDf <- merge(mainDf, relDf, by.x="GlobalID", 
                    by.y="ParentGlobalID", all=TRUE)
  
  #Generate file name based on Df names
  mainName <- deparse(substitute(pair$main))
  ooutputFile <- paste0(mainName, "full.csv")
  
  # Save merged Df to csv
  wriste.csv(mergedDf, file = outputFile, row.names=FALSE)
  
  cat(sprintf("Saved merged data to '%s' \n", outputFile))
}
